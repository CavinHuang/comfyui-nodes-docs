# FL Image Size
## Documentation
- Class name: `FL_ImageDimensionDisplay`
- Category: `üèµÔ∏èFill Nodes`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to calculate and display the dimensions of an image, supporting both individual images and batches of images in various formats. It abstracts the complexity of handling different image representations, providing a straightforward way to obtain image dimensions.
## Input types
### Required
- **`image`**
    - The image input is crucial for determining the dimensions of the provided image. It supports both tensor and PIL image formats, adapting its processing based on the input type to accurately return the image dimensions.
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - Python dtype: `Union[torch.Tensor, Image.Image]`
## Output types
- **`string`**
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - Outputs the dimensions of the provided image as a string, formatted to include both width and height.
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown


## Source code
```python
class FL_ImageDimensionDisplay:
    @classmethod
    def INPUT_TYPES(cls):
        return {
            "required": {
                "image": ("IMAGE", {}),
            }
        }

    RETURN_TYPES = ("STRING",)
    FUNCTION = "display_dimensions"
    CATEGORY = "üèµÔ∏èFill Nodes"

    def display_dimensions(self, image):
        # Check the number of dimensions in the image tensor to correctly unpack the dimensions
        if isinstance(image, torch.Tensor):
            if image.dim() == 4:  # Batch dimension is present
                _, height, width, _, = image.shape
            elif image.dim() == 3:  # No batch dimension, single image
                _, height, width = image.shape
            else:
                return ("Unsupported tensor format",)
        elif isinstance(image, Image.Image):
            width, height = image.size
        else:
            return ("Unsupported image format",)

        # Correctly assign width and height
        dimensions = f"Width: {width}, Height: {height}"

        # Display dimensions in the UI. This might need to be adapted.
        print(dimensions)

        # Return the dimensions as a string.
        return (dimensions,)
