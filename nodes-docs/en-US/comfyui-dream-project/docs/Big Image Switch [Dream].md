# â­† Big Image Switch
## Documentation
- Class name: `Big Image Switch [Dream]`
- Category: `âœ¨ Dream/ðŸ›  utils/â­† switches`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to switch between different image inputs based on a selection criterion, allowing for dynamic image selection within a workflow.
## Input types
### Required
- **`select`**
    - Determines which image input to select based on the provided criterion, enabling dynamic image selection.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`on_missing`**
    - Specifies the action to take when the selected image input is missing, ensuring robustness in image selection.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `Callable`
### Optional
- **`input_i`**
    - Represents one of the multiple image inputs that can be selected. The index 'i' varies, indicating each distinct image input available for selection.
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - Python dtype: `Image`
## Output types
- **`selected`**
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - The image that has been selected based on the provided criterion.
    - Python dtype: `Image`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
