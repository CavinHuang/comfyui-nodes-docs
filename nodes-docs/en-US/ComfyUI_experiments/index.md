# ComfyUI_experiments
ComfyUI_experiments introduces a collection of experimental custom nodes designed to enhance the functionality of ComfyUI, a user interface framework. These nodes include features such as applying a simple tonemapping algorithm to manage noise in images, implementing Rescale Classifier-Free Guidance for image processing, and providing methods for merging models by block or specifically for SDXL base models. Additionally, it offers a node for "reference only controlnet," aimed at refining workflow processes.
