# style_aligned_comfy
StyleAligned for ComfyUI is an implementation of the StyleAligned technique specifically designed for ComfyUI, which includes two nodes for style alignment in image generation without requiring additional models or dependencies. The first node, StyleAligned Reference Sampler, allows for referencing an existing latent as a style reference for generating images with a consistent style, while the second node, StyleAligned Batch Align, aligns the style of an entire batch of images with the first generated image to ensure uniform style across the batch.
