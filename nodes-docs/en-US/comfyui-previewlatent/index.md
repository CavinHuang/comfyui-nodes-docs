# comfyui-previewlatent
comfyui-previewlatent is a ComfyUI plugin designed for previewing latents without the need for VAE decoding, offering a faster alternative for generating "preview images." It allows for the direct forwarding of input latents to output for quick testing and intermediate result showcasing, supporting full-resolution previews and the use of taesd (or latent2rgb) for decoding.
