# CR Cycle Images (Legacy)
## Documentation
- Class name: `CR Cycle Images`
- Category: `ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/ðŸŽ¥ Animation/ðŸ’€ Legacy`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to cycle through a sequence of images based on specified parameters, allowing for the creation of animations or slideshows. It supports looping through the images multiple times and selecting images in a sequential order, providing a dynamic visual experience.
## Input types
### Required
- **`mode`**
    - Specifies the cycling mode, which determines how images are selected during the animation. 'Sequential' mode cycles through images in the order they are provided.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`image_list`**
    - A list of images to be cycled through. Each item in the list represents an image and its associated parameters, enabling complex animations.
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE_LIST`
    - Python dtype: `List[Tuple[str, Any]]`
- **`frame_interval`**
    - The interval between frames, which controls the speed of the animation. A lower value results in a faster animation.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`loops`**
    - Determines how many times the sequence of images is repeated, allowing for continuous animations.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`current_frame`**
    - The current frame number in the animation sequence. It is used to calculate which image to display at any given time.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
## Output types
- **`IMAGE`**
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - The current image to be displayed based on the cycling logic. It changes over time as the animation progresses.
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`show_help`**
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - A URL to a help page providing additional information and guidance on using the node.
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
