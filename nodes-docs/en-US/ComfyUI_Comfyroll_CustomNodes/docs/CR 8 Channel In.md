# ðŸšŒ CR 8 Channel In
## Documentation
- Class name: `CR 8 Channel In`
- Category: `ðŸ§© Comfyroll Studio/âœ¨ Essential/ðŸŽ· Pipe/ðŸšŒ Bus`
- Output node: `False`

The CR 8 Channel In node is designed to facilitate the input of data across eight distinct channels within a pipeline, enabling complex data handling and manipulation for advanced processing tasks.
## Input types
### Required
### Optional
- **`pipe`**
    - The 'pipe' parameter represents the pipeline through which data is inputted into the node, serving as the conduit for the eight distinct channels of data that are to be processed.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `tuple`
- **`ch1`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch2`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch3`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch4`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch5`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch6`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch7`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
- **`ch8`**
    - Represents one of the eight channels through which data can be inputted into the node, allowing for complex data handling and manipulation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `Any`
## Output types
- **`pipe`**
    - Comfy dtype: `PIPE_LINE`
    - This output type signifies the continuation of the pipeline, carrying forward the data processed within the node to subsequent stages.
    - Python dtype: `tuple`
- **`show_help`**
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - Provides a link to helpful documentation or further information regarding the node's functionality.
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
