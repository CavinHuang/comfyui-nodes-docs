# ComfyUI-CCSR
ComfyUI-CCSR is a simple wrapper node designed to work with the CCSR upscaler, providing a means to upscale images. It is not a fully optimized implementation of ComfyUI, potentially leading to inefficiency and memory issues, but has been tested to work well with a 4090 graphics card for 4x upscale tiling.
