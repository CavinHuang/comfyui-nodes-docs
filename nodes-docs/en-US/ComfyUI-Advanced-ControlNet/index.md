# ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet
ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet is designed to enhance the functionality of ControlNet nodes by allowing users to schedule ControlNet strength across timesteps and batched latents, apply custom weights, and use attention masks. It supports a variety of ControlNet types, including ControlNets, T2IAdapters, ControlLoRAs, and more, for advanced image manipulation tasks. The project also includes features for replicating the "My prompt is more important" functionality from Auto1111's sd-webui ControlNet extension, and supports sliding context sampling for dynamic image generation and manipulation.
