# tiled_ksampler
tiled_ksampler introduces nodes for image processing that extend the functionality of the standard KSampler. It includes a Tiled KSampler Node for regular tiling effects, an Asymmetric Tiled KSampler Node for directional tiling, and a Circular VAE Decoder to prevent edge bleeding in decoded images. These tools are designed to enhance image sampling and manipulation by offering tiling options and improving image quality.
