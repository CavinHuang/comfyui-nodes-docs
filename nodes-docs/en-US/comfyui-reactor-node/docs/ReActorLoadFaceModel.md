# Load Face Model ðŸŒŒ ReActor
## Documentation
- Class name: `ReActorLoadFaceModel`
- Category: `ðŸŒŒ ReActor`
- Output node: `False`

The ReActorLoadFaceModel node is designed for loading face models into the ReActor system. It facilitates the retrieval and application of pre-trained face models, enabling the enhancement or modification of facial features in images.
## Input types
### Required
- **`face_model`**
    - Specifies the name of the face model to be loaded. This parameter is crucial for identifying and retrieving the correct model from a predefined set of available models, impacting the accuracy and effectiveness of face-related operations.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Output types
- **`face_model`**
    - Comfy dtype: `FACE_MODEL`
    - Returns the loaded face model, which can be utilized for further face manipulation tasks within the ReActor system.
    - Python dtype: `dict`
## Usage tips
