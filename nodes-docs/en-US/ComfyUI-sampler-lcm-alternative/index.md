# ComfyUI-sampler-lcm-alternative
ComfyUI-sampler-lcm-alternative introduces three new custom sampler nodes for ComfyUI, enhancing the LCM sampler functions with additional parameters and functionalities. These nodes, named SamplerLCMAlternative, SamplerLCMCycle, and LCMScheduler, offer users the ability to fine-tune their sampling process with options for Euler steps, cycle repetition of Euler and LCM sampling steps, and the injection of randomness to improve image quality and detail. The project aims to provide more versatile and detailed sampling options for users working with ComfyUI.
