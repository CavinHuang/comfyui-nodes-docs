# ComfyUI-AutomaticCFG
ComfyUI-AutomaticCFG is a project designed to automatically rescale the CFG (Control Flow Graph) to prevent burn-in on displays and improve image generation quality and speed. It introduces a self-rescaling mechanism that can increase speed by up to 50% with its latest update, and it focuses on quality over strict prompt adherence, though it also tends to follow prompts more closely. The project includes features like a "boost" toggle for doubling inference speed, a negative strength version for blending conditional and unconditional inputs, and an advanced node for users interested in experimenting further.
