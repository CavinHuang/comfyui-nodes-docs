# ðŸ›Œ Sleep ðŸ›Œ
## Documentation
- Class name: `Sleep`
- Category: `KJNodes/misc`
- Output node: `False`

Delays the execution for the input amount of time, allowing for a pause in operations based on specified minutes and seconds.
## Input types
### Required
- **`input`**
    - A placeholder input that is returned after the delay, ensuring the flow of data is maintained throughout the node's operation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `any`
- **`minutes`**
    - Specifies the duration of the delay in whole minutes, contributing to the total delay time alongside seconds.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`seconds`**
    - Specifies the duration of the delay in fractional minutes (seconds), fine-tuning the total delay time in conjunction with minutes.
    - Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`
    - Python dtype: `float`
## Output types
- **`*`**
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Returns the input data unchanged after the specified delay, serving as a pass-through with a time delay.
    - Python dtype: `any`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
