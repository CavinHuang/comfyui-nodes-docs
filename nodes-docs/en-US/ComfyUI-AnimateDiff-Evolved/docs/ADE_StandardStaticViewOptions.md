# View Options‚óÜStandard Static üé≠üÖêüÖì
## Documentation
- Class name: `ADE_StandardStaticViewOptions`
- Category: `Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/context opts/view opts`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to create static view options for the Animate Diff process, allowing for the customization of view length and overlap with optional fuse method adjustments.
## Input types
### Required
- **`view_length`**
    - Specifies the length of the view, affecting the granularity of the animation frames.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`view_overlap`**
    - Determines the overlap between consecutive views, influencing the smoothness of the animation transition.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
### Optional
- **`fuse_method`**
    - Optional parameter that defines the method for fusing context, offering flexibility in the animation's visual continuity.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Output types
- **`view_opts`**
    - Comfy dtype: `VIEW_OPTS`
    - Outputs the configured view options, ready to be utilized in the Animate Diff process.
    - Python dtype: `ContextOptions`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
