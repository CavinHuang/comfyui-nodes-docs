# Combine LoRA Hooks [4] üé≠üÖêüÖì
## Documentation
- Class name: `ADE_CombineLoraHooksFour`
- Category: `Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/conditioning/combine lora hooks`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to aggregate and combine up to four LoRA hooks into a single, unified LoRA hook group. It facilitates the integration of multiple LoRA hook modifications, allowing for more complex and nuanced adjustments to model behavior within the Animate Diff framework.
## Input types
### Required
### Optional
- **`lora_hook_A`**
    - Represents the first LoRA hook group to be combined. It plays a crucial role in the aggregation process, contributing to the overall modifications applied.
    - Comfy dtype: `LORA_HOOK`
    - Python dtype: `LoraHookGroup`
- **`lora_hook_B`**
    - Serves as the second LoRA hook group for combination. Its inclusion allows for the layering of modifications, enhancing the model's adaptability.
    - Comfy dtype: `LORA_HOOK`
    - Python dtype: `LoraHookGroup`
- **`lora_hook_C`**
    - The third LoRA hook group in the combination process. It adds another layer of customization, further refining the model's behavior.
    - Comfy dtype: `LORA_HOOK`
    - Python dtype: `LoraHookGroup`
- **`lora_hook_D`**
    - Represents the fourth and final LoRA hook group to be combined. It completes the set of modifications, enabling a comprehensive adjustment to the model.
    - Comfy dtype: `LORA_HOOK`
    - Python dtype: `LoraHookGroup`
## Output types
- **`lora_hook`**
    - Comfy dtype: `LORA_HOOK`
    - The result of combining up to four LoRA hooks into a single, unified group. This consolidated hook group allows for enhanced and more complex model conditioning.
    - Python dtype: `LoraHookGroup`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
