# üß™Inject I2V into AnimateDiff Model üé≠üÖêüÖì‚ë°
## Documentation
- Class name: `ADE_InjectI2VIntoAnimateDiffModel`
- Category: `Animate Diff üé≠üÖêüÖì/‚ë° Gen2 nodes ‚ë°/AnimateLCM-I2V/üß™experimental`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to integrate the I2V (Image to Video) model into the AnimateDiff framework, enhancing its capabilities by incorporating motion models. It serves as a bridge to enrich AnimateDiff's animation process with additional motion dynamics, facilitating a more complex and nuanced animation output.
## Input types
### Required
- **`model_name`**
    - Specifies the name of the motion model to be loaded, playing a crucial role in determining the animation's motion dynamics.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`motion_model`**
    - Represents the motion model object to be injected into the AnimateDiff model, crucial for applying specific motion dynamics to the animation process.
    - Comfy dtype: `MOTION_MODEL_ADE`
    - Python dtype: `MotionModelPatcher`
### Optional
- **`ad_settings`**
    - Optional settings for the AnimateDiff process, allowing for customization of the animation's appearance and behavior.
    - Comfy dtype: `AD_SETTINGS`
    - Python dtype: `AnimateDiffSettings`
## Output types
- **`MOTION_MODEL`**
    - Comfy dtype: `MOTION_MODEL_ADE`
    - The enhanced AnimateDiff model with the injected I2V capabilities, ready for animation tasks.
    - Python dtype: `MotionModelPatcher`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
