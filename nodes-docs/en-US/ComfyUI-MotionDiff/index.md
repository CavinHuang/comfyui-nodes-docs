# ComfyUI-MotionDiff
ComfyUI-MotionDiff integrates several motion and pose estimation technologies such as 4DHuman, MotionGPT, MDM, MotionDiffuse, and ReMoDiffuse into ComfyUI, enhancing its capabilities in generating and rendering 3D poses from various inputs. It offers functionalities for estimating 3D poses, generating motion frames, and converting motion data to SMPL format for visualization, with support for various parameters to adjust the output quality and details. The project also includes features for saving and loading SMPL data, allowing for easy export to 3DCGI software like Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity.
